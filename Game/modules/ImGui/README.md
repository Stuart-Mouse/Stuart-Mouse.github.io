# Jai-ImGui

This repository contains the Docking branch of [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/docking) updated to version 1.91.9b.
So it's not the same thing as the module that's shipped with Jai.
I will try to keep it as updated as possible, but I'm open to pull request if I haven't done it.

It should work on linux, but the `unix.jai` is not always updated since I don't always have a linux machine.
Same for Macos.
Feel free to generate it yourself and make a pull request if you want.

This repo uses Git submodules, so clone with :

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/Stowy/jai-imgui.git --recursive
```

To generate the bindings, run :

```
jai generate.jai
```

However this will not compile ImGui. To do this, you need to run : 

```
jai generate.jai - -compile
```
