Fish pond, where you can feed the fish

## First demo

TV with various channels
unused channels will show some static
can easily add new channels over time
channels could have interactivity or just show visuals/sounds
    interactivity could have conditions that link user to other pages
    
    
    
image of tv is static image or a few frames for flickering light or soemthing
crop out area of tube/screen and replace with transparency
render contents of screen into viewport for screen area first, then render the tv image over top
also, could use some overlay for scanlines



when channel is changed, show little blurb of static between channels



interactivity
first just need buttons to turn on tv and to change channel
so three rects with interaction
