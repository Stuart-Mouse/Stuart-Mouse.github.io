</div><h1>I am making a game in Jai, and you can (probably) play it right now</h1>
<p>This will probably serve as a shorter post simply to announce the fact that I am working on a game in Jai, which you can (probably) go play right now at <a href="https://stuart-mouse.github.io/Game">stuart-mouse.github.io/Game</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/game/b2.png" alt="" title="Screenshot"></p>
<p>This game will be a challenging platformer with a unique take on randomization.
The currently available demo is just a single level, and obviously not representative of the final game, but I wanted to put it out there just to guage interest and to show off the state of Jai's WASM capabilities.</p>
<p>As of right now, the game can only be played on Chrome-based browsers, and even then it may require setting some flags in your browser settings.
(On Brave, you may need to enable the 'Override software rendering list' browser flag.)
I expect this situation to improve over time, and will update this page with more information as I find out about issues and potential fixes.</p>
<p>The art style is inspired by old C64 and ZX-spectrum games with single-color tiles and sprites, but with an added sort of flair achieved through a rather simple system of animated color palettes.
It is intended to be very basic so that I can focus more solely on the level design and technical aspects of the game, but I think it looks decent enough.</p>
<p>I will have a lot to talk about in the coming weeks and months, with respect to both the work I have already done on the game and the work I plan to do in the future.
Some future articles to look forward will cover topics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing my own data file formats (text and binary) in Jai</li>
<li>Writing my own scripting language in Jai</li>
<li>Getting a WASM build running with Simp</li>
<li>Games that inspired my own</li>
<li>Developing the game's art style</li>
<li>The game's main design goals</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any feedback about the game, feel free to send me an email and voice your opinions.
Chances are I will be ignoring most criticism until I feel like I have adequately implemented my primary design goals,
but if you have thoughtful critiques, I will take them into consideration.</p>
