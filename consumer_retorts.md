### Nursing Homes

"Must you die poor?"

Left to rot by their selfish children, elders across the country find themselves facing the daily abuse of nursing home staff.

Some earned it, and others face an injustice great than that of Job.

There's an interesting symmetry to the way in which we now isolate ourselves, dropping our kids off at daycare during their most formative years, and leaving our elders to waste away instead of enjoying their twilight years with those in whom they've invested everything.

Certainly this pattern is more noticeable at the fringes, but it permeates through our entire lifespan. From daycare to the public school system, to corporate jobs, and finally to the nursing home and hospice, the modern american life is wholly contained within the managerial system.
It's like a bell curve of freedom where the peak never rises above the that which was known to your typical farmer from the middle ages.

By trying to hold on to the menial liberties of so-called adulthood, we deny the dignity of our parents and children alike, and for what?
We sell the souls of not only ourselves, but those to whom we have the most duty in this life for the small price of a nine-to-five and weekend. 

Instead of housing your aging mother (who clothed you, fed you, and wiped your stinky ass for two decades), you can throw her in the looney bin and fill the void with some annoying little untrained fru-fru dog that shits on the floor and won't shut the fuck up.

Without a family or future to tie you down, you're free to experience one of the simple pleasures of life: attending the renaissance fair, by yourself, as a 40-year-old man.

The only justice we can hope for in this life is that all those who left their parents to die alone in a nursing home will soon face the same for themselves.
Fortunately, this is essentially a forgone conlusion for those who have adopted the DINK life and taken themselves out of the gene pool.
Unfortunately, these people have also been given the right to vote and will probably require you by law to pay for their stinky old butts to be wiped by immigrants working for minimum wage.

For all that the millenials will lament the selfishness of the boomer generation, at least the boomers only expected their old age to be subsidized by their own children.
The millenials on the other hand, will expect their decline to be propped up by those to whom they have no relation. 
Their earthly comfort is simply owed to them by "society" generally (a vapid concept usually lacking any real referrent),

### Microwaves (Miracle or Mystery)

Even years after their invention, no one knows how the microwave *actually* works. 
Scientists have determined that it has something to do with magnets, but unfortunately, we don't know how those work either.
However, one day soon, Science may find the answer. The labcoats are hard at work devising a yet-more complex and unprovable theory that just might explain the nature of the universe (and along with it, microwaves).

The microwave is more than just a means to heat one's food. It is a symbol of the modern age. 
The pre-modern man was forced to wait upwards to _2 minutes_ to heat his toaster pastries. 
On an already fraught morning, this could delay his commute by enough to cost him the job.
Now, one can microwave a pop-tart in a mere 30 seconds, saving him both time, money, and 


It is because of innovations like the microwave that we know we truly live in better times.
Some will doubt that the endless forward march of the technological machine has been worthwhile
let those doubts be assuaged by the gentle caress of microsopic waves, producing a sort of hum reminiscent of the sound of the ocean tides

the next generation of microwaves
with the onset of 5g technology, we will finally be able to free the waves from the confines of the iconic set-top box
your local 5g tower will be able to heat your coffee remotely 


### Cars

getting around has never been easier
by moving to electric, we can encourage the healthy growth of our wide urban roads while simultaneously clamping down on the anti-social behaviour of those living out in the boonies.

### Lawn Mowers (you don't need one)

you don't even have a lawn, and if you do, you probably don't own it

### Championship Breakfast

We compare the top brands on the qualities you value most. 
    color, flavor, speed, endurance, creativity

ranking by more color = better
more sugar = better
less prep time = better
more preservatives = better
less it looks like real food = better

Imagine that your breakfast foods are running a race. 
    You want to see a complexion that portrays vibrance and energy.
    You want your food to have endurance, the ability to go months without molding.
    You want your breakfast to be a self-starter. If you have to heat your food just to make it edible, it probably wasn't safe to eat in the first place.
    Modern foods are treated with special science chemicals to make them hardier and healthier.
