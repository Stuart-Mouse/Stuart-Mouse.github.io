</div><h1>How to design a TEiN level</h1>
<p>This is not so much a tutorial on how to use the actual tools, rather it's intended to give you some principles that will help with the actual design process.</p>
<p>Before we actually get into the design process, we'll go over a few basic rules that you should essentially always be following.
These are the kind of rules that you need a <strong>very</strong> good reason to break, and if you're a beginner then any reason you may think you have is probably not actually a good enough.</p>
<ol>
<li>The player should always be safe when entering a level.</li>
</ol>
<p>sometimes, it is nearly impossible for the level design to avoid potentially killing the player in the starting position.
but even in such cases, one should give the player a sufficient amount of time to react to and avoid the thing that can kill them</p>
<p>Always leave about 3 tiles of margin between the edge of the screen and anything that can kill the player</p>
<p>don't use automatically falling movement tags. You almost invariably want to use the player-triggered falling movmenet tags and just have the falling trigger as soon as the player moves out of the starting zone</p>
<h2>common design advice</h2>
<p>this is the kind of advice you can apply to almost any game's design. I remember hearing this kind of advice all the time in Mario Maker.</p>
<p>use a small subset of the game's mechanics in each area
It's very common for beginners to create levels or areas where they use almost every single entity in the game.
This is probably because the player is much more likely to get at least a couple ideas about how to use all the various elements in the game,
but they haven't yet spent enough time thinking deeply about each individual element to generate several ideas about how to use that one element.</p>
<p>your levels are always much easier for you then they are for everyone else</p>
<p>give space for your level design to breathe
this is even more important in tein because the camera doesn't move
you should not be packing so much stuff into a single level
aim for roughly 10-30 seconds of gameplay on a screen
if a single level takes more than 15 seconds to beat when played perfectly, it's probably too long</p>
<h2>The design process</h2>
<p>understand that the movement tags are the most interesting part of the game's design
if your level does not make use of movement tags in some way, then it's probably a very boring level</p>
<p>making absurdly tight jumps and navigating snaking hallways of kukos is really not fun!</p>
<p>levels don't always need a gimmick.
just having solid and interesting layouts is often good enough</p>
<p>It's very possible that my design process may sound a little too abstract, or be hard to seehow one puts it into practice.</p>
<p>So after giving an overview of my process I'll actually go through it as well to show how you can take something very abstract and make it into a real level.</p>
<p>I generally start by thinking about the motion that I want the level to have
this can be some pattern of motion which objects int eh level will follow, or some intersting path for the player to traverse.
At this stage, the idea is something extremely basic, just a couple of general shapes.</p>
<p>Focus on a couple basic shapes and then consider how those shapes can be composed in interesting permutations
scale and rotate the shapes, flip them on each axis, consider how two or more shapes may intersect
and remember that these shapes represent motion, where an object may be across some span of time
if you have multiple objects moving along different paths, consider how the objects' relative phase will affect their interaction</p>
<p>for beginners, it's very natural to just sit down and start drawing a level
very often just &quot;filling space&quot;
if you are simply &quot;filling space&quot;, then again, the levle design is probably not very intersting.</p>
<p>Now, there are times when you do need to just fill space in between the major elements of the level
this is what I would refer to as the sort of &quot;connective tissue&quot; of a level</p>
<p>this connective tissue should be kept simple, and relatively easy compared to the level's main features.
If the player is consistently dying in these sections of connective tissue, then they should be simplified further.</p>
<p>the method of thinking about levels in terms of these very simple shapes is a method which probably will only work for a very small subset of games
You probably could not design mario bros levels in this way, at least not to the same degree.
it is really particular to this game's design that this method works at all
something to do with the very simple and compact nature of the game's level design</p>
<p>Personally, I have a historicaly been bad about feeling like every single level should do something completely original to surprise the player
but this is something like letting the perfect bet he enemy of the good
originality is not the be-all end-all
the overall design of an area will benefit more from being a cohesive sequence of inter-related ideas
If you come up with a fun system of moving parts, you should feel free to explore different arangements that highlight the interesting parts of this composition.
player with the phase of the motion and change it fluidly into something else across a sequence of levels</p>
<p>If you have some sequence of smaler obstacles</p>
<p>because tein has such compact levels, you'll generally only be able to have 1-3 main obstacles per level.</p>
<p>connecting levels together</p>
<p>it's often a good idea to wait until you have a large collection of obstacles for an area before even finishing out individual levels
This will give you more freedom to reorder or rearrange levels within an area
can change where the exits on each level are located, sometimes
this is easier to do if you have some margin in the level layout. another reason not to over-stuff your levels</p>
<p>it's better to have an area with 25 small levels than 15 levels that are too long and cramped</p>
<p>understanding what makes certain mechanics most interesting
consider precisely what constraint the mechanic places on the player
consider how a mechanic acts as a modifier on the underlying level geometry</p>
<p>gas clouds are a great example
gas clouds are a sort of soft constraint
both a sort of time constraint and a space constraint
if you just have some hallway entirely covered in gas, then it's merely a 'do it faster' constraint
which is not really that intersting most of the time
you can also use gas clouds as a way of partitioning space into safe and unsafe regions
this is more intersting than a simple time constraint, because it makes the player actually consider where they are going
they may have to take a non-obvious route through the level simply due to the way the gas clouds parttion the space
if you can come up with a layout that would require the player to play the level differently based solely on where the gas clouds are placed, that's interesting</p>
<p>when combining multiple different mechanics, consider how the constraints those mechanics place on the player can be played against one another</p>
<p>some constraints for the player to keep moving, others force the player to wait
juxtaposing these creates tension
the base game does this sort of thing in many places</p>
<p>collapsing motion can be either a waiting or hurry-up mechanism
crumbling tiles force the player to hurry up, but with somevariability
also a space constraint, as the breaking of a tile changes the levle layout
player may need to think about the order in which they use crumbling tiles, treat as a sort of consumable resource
mother is similar to crumbling tiles in a way, forces the player to keep moving, stay on their toes,
can also be used to block off paths
can force player to back off and come back after mother retreats
e.g. player goes under low ceiling with mother, gets trapped into another space. unless player gets far enough away, they won't be able to get back out</p>
<p>weighted platforms can be used to force the player to stay grounded, if the player needs to pull down some piece of level geometry
can easily play this against some element that tries to get the player to jump
e.g. attach a gun to the same platform the player is trying to lower, or make the player navigate down through someguns anchored to the walls
can also be used to keep the player jumping, depending on the surrounding level geometry
can even swap back and forth if the other level geometry is changing dynamically</p>
<p>designing a level from layout first is the wrong way around
start from things that are more primitive, then use layout or arrangement to facilitate the level's mechanics</p>
<p>reusing space</p>
<p>movement tags can bring in structures from offscreen
essentially allowing for more vertical levels
cyclic movement with wrap tags
somewhat limited, but can create very interesting level designs
buttons + locked doors
it's a common trope to have certain layouts where the player needs to hit several buttons in order to open the exit door
clever use of collapsing movement tags, revealing new paths as the player moves through the level</p>
