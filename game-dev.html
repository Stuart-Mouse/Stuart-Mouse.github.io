            <h1>Game Development</h1>
            <p>
                In my scant free time I do a little bit of casual game development. 
                I hope to make this more of a priority going forward, but I'm mostly caught up in work and programming projects at the moment.
                Fortunately my scripting language is almost done and I should be able to start on my first major project soon.

            <h2>Games in Odin</h2>
            <p>
                Here are some simple engines I wrote last year for a entry to game programming class I taught. 
                There's PONG, Zelda, and Super Mario Bros. engines with some basic level editors and dear imgui integration.
                Compiling these engines will require having <a href="https://github.com/ThisDevDane/odin-imgui">odin-imgui</a> and my <a href="https://github.com/Stuart-Mouse/odin-imgui-extras">odin-imgui-extras</a> (used for some wrapper functions and data reflection).
            </p>

      <div class="image-grid-item"><img src="/images/odin-games/pong-1.png"></div>
    
      <div class="image-grid-item"><img src="/images/odin-games/mario-1.png"></div>
    
      <div class="image-grid-item"><img src="/images/odin-games/zelda-1.png"></div>
    
</div>



            <p>
                These engines were all written in SDL, and were primarily intended for use as a teaching tool. 
                As the semester went on though, we added quite a bit as a class to each game, and that additional code is somewhat hacked on in some cases.
                If you would like to read more about each individual game, please follow the links below.

            </ul>
            <p>
                Now to be perfectly honest, the code quality on display here could certainly be better.
                Because I was on quite the time crunch, certain aspects are rushed and may not be ideal examples.
                But if you've never written a platformer or top-down game engine before, these examples are simple enough that you could certainly use them as a jumping-off point.
                If I had the spare time to do so, I would definitely like to refactor and improve these (and probably also remove the blatant copyright infringement) so that beginners could use them as a real learning tool.

            <h2>OpenEnded</h2>
            <p>
                OpenEnded was an engine I was developing in C for a new precision platforming game.
                As the name implies, it was highly inspired by The End is Nigh, but brought in a lot of ideas from other precision platforming games.
                In particular, the engine has a unique approach to movement, both for the player and the tilemaps in a level.
                My first two devlogs were written about the game's movement components, and although those are now outdated, you may still find them of interest.
                Now, I've essentially ported all the important bits to Jai to continue my work there.
                This game will be released in some form one day, but it will be much more than just a TEiN clone!
                Click <a href="/oe-videos.html">here</a> to see some old videos of the game in action.

            <h2>Wonky Kong</h2>
            <p>
                A new spin on arcade-style platformers like Donkey Kong, Burger Time, Wrecking Crew, and others in that vein.
                Potentially with rouglike elements and competitive multiplayer?
                More to be announced soon! 
            </p>

            <h2>The End is Nigh Mods (and Randomizer)</h2>
			<p>
				These are pretty old and mostly abandoned at this point, but if you're interested in some of my teenage game design efforts, you can check out my TEiN mods.
				I still think they're relatively well-made for what they are, so if you're a fan of the game I hope you can enjoy some new levels to play around with.
				My old TEiN modding page can be seen <a href="/tein.html">here</a>.
