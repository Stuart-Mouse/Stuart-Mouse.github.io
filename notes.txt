Level building
1. Basics (Tiles, Enemies, Backgrounds)
    a. using the editor
    b. basic hotkeys, settings
2. Tags (movement tags, buttons, bg/fg, transitions, checkpooints, spawn)
3. Aesthetics (backgrounds, foreground shapes, theming, pipes, agons)
4. Advanced Techniques (
  overlapping Tiles (gaspergons)
  half blocks
  advanced button shenanigans (kuko clock, locking door, single use buttons, multi-purpose buttons soft machine block movement)
  hanging things from chains
  wind effects
  art alting
  particles
)
5. Approaches to designing levels
(
  experimenting with mechanics
  blocking out basic designs (additive, subtractive)
  creating flow (momentum, movement cycles, )

  obstacle-oriented designing
  aesthetics-oriented designing

  difficulty / balance
  things not to do (static levels, spikes everywhere)
)
