        <h3>Cleaning up the Project, and Regrets</h3>
        <p>
          If you haven't read it already, the post below gives a brief background on the development up to this point.
          When I began working on the map generator, it quickly became apparent that the entire randomizer was in for big changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before I could even properly begin developing the new feature, I found myself rewriting and reorganizing large swaths of the code base.
          The project was long overdue for a cleanup, and this one was quite extensive (though there are still some more peripheral classes that could use some attention).
        </p>
        <p>
          Having worked on this project for much longer than I initally anticipated, I somewhat wish that I had stuck with the original plan to build the project in C++.
          I'm now learning how to use SDL2, which would allow me to create a more impressive menu than the WPF one I have now.
          But for the time being, it's not worth re-writing thousands of lines of code.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Why didn't I do this earlier?</h3>
        <p>
          Although it seems like one of the most elemental things to include in a randomizer, I opted not to mess with map generation when I began the project.
          Map generation in TEiN is complicated, which is why up until now I was just generating the randomizer levels in a straight line.
          This let me focus on randomizing pure gameplay features. I still think this was a good idea as it allowed me to not get bogged down right at the start with one of the most complicated challenges in TEiN randomization.
          Not to mention, I had no prior C# experience, so trying to tackle smaller things first was a good idea.</p>
        
        <h3>Challenges of Map Generation</h3>
        <p>
          Time to finally talk about something technical!
          In TEiN, the world's map is stored as a spreadsheet. Yes, a spreadsheet.
          Or more specifically, a csv (comma seperated values) file.
          This is simply a text document which seperates column values in a line by a comma.
          The first and easiest requirement of manipulating this file is loading it into memory as a 2D array, and being able to store it back to a csv.
          This is basically trivial.
        </p>
        <p>
          The difficulty of map generation lies not in the storage container, but in the way which the csv is read and levels are connected in-game.
          Despite being such a simple format, the map files of TEiN allow for some complicated methods of connecting levels.
          Each cell on the spreadsheet contains the file name of a certain level. When a player is in the corresponding level, they are basically "in" this cell.
          If the player hits a screen transition tag in the level, they will be moved to the adjacent cell in the corresponding direction.
          In this new level, they will be placed on the nth transition tag, n being the number of transition tag that they left the previous level by.

          
          The biggest wrinkle is the function of ".." cells on the map. These allow a map connection to carry over an arbitrary number of

        <h2 class="center">A Brief History of the TEiN Randomizer</h2>

        <p>
          As the first real dev update, I think a recap is probably in order. I first started working on the current incarnation of the randomizer this February (2021).
          I say this incarnation because I did make a basic TEiN randomizer back in 2018 in Python. Unfortunately this program was not very good and I gave up on it relatively soon after starting it.
          Since starting work on this new version, I have continued to add new features throughout the year, until recently when I realized I was running out of things to randomize.
          Now I am beginning work on the map generator, which I believe will totally overhaul the randomizer experience.
        </p>

        <h3>Adding Basic Features</h3>
        <p>
          My initial plan was to rewrite the original Python randomizer in C++ (which took hardly any time at all) and then begin adding new features. Perhaps the most important feature however, is a menu.
          At this point I looked to the TEiN mod loader, which had a simple, well functioning UI. Although I had never working in C# before, I decided to build the randomizer on top of the mod loader.
          I learned the basics of C# and how to use WPF in order to customize the menu (which has now gone through several iterations).
          After a month, I put up the first public release (version 0.9), which already had randomization of music, palettes, shaders, particles (including a custom particle generator), overlays, tile graphics, and art alts, as well as support for modded levels.
          Basically anything I could possibly randomize simply by manipulating the data files was already supported.
        </p>

        <h3>Subsequent Releases</h3>
        <p>
          The next release came two months later. The big improvement here was the inclusion of level corruptors and physics randomization.
          Adding level corruptors was a big deal to me because this entailed being able to read in and algorithmically edit level files.
          This opens up tons of possibilities for modifying gameplay with the use of simple rulesets/functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          After working with the corruptors and getting a handle on manipulating level files, I began working on a level generator which would build levels by connecting random level pieces together.
          This is still not complete, as I've put off finishing this in favor of working other features which I think will add more value to the experience (namely the map generator).
        </p>
        <p>
          The physics randomization is still a bit janky to this day (there's not much getting around this), but it was designed in order to maximize the chances of getting something that is relatively playable.
        </p>
        <p>
          The menu had also been reformatted to be much more readable, as the level pools, settings, etc. had been moved to seperate tabs.
          Some modding tools were also included that would manipulate levels in ways not supported by the TEiN Editor.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final official release added NPC randomization, as well as some slight menu improvements. There's not much else to be said about this one.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was however another release that I sent out to testers in the TEiN Modding Discord channel, but I guess I forgot to upload it on Github.
          This build re-implemented mod loading (including multi-mod loading), and added a few mod randomization options. This is a feature I would like to expand further after finishing the map generator.
          There were also further menu improvements and improved corruptor settings which allowed for a more fine-tuned experience.
        </p>

        <h3>Where to go from here?</h3>
        <p>
          Throughout the entire development process, there was always the looming question of what feature could be added next. The scope of the project has continually expanded further than I expected it could.
          Now, there are three main features that remain:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>map generation</li>
          <li>game memory manipulation</li>
          <li>level generation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Each of these features poses a unique challenge in its implementation, but I think the potential rewards make the challenge worth it.
          I would like to go into each of these in more detail at a later date, because I find them all very interesting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, that's all for this first post. It's probably already far too long-winded anyways.
          I will probably go more in-depth on individual aspects of the randomizer at a later time, but that time is not now.
